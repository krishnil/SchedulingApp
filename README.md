# Scheduling Application
This is a scheduling desktop user interface application I developed for my Software 2 - Advanced Java Concepts class. This application was created for a global consulting organization conducting business in multiple languages (Scenario). A MySQL database was provided by the school to pull data from.

## Summary
I created a log-in form that can determine the user's location and translate the log-in and error control messages to Japanese if the user is from an office in Japan. The Application has:
  * the ability to add, update, and delete customer records in the database, including name, address and phone number.
  * the ability to add, update, and delete appointments, capturing the type of appointment and link to the specific customer record.
  * the ability to view schedule by month and by week.
  * the ability to adjust appointment times based on user time zones and daylight saving time.
  * exception controls to prevent incomplete data and incorrect usernames and passwords.
  * the ability to alert if there is an appointment within 15 minutes of the user's log-in.
  * the ability to generate reports and track user activity in logs.
 
## Concepts Learned
  * Producing database and file server applications using advanced Java programming language constructs.
  * Incorporating lambda expressions in application development to meet business requirements more efficiently.
  * Incorporating streams and filters in application development to manipulate data more efficiently.
  * Applying the localization API and date/time API in application development to support end-users in various geographical regions.
  * Incorporating advanced exception control mechanisms in application development for improving user experience and application stability.
